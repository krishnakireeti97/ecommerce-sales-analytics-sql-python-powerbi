# 📊 E-Commerce Sales Analytics Project

An end-to-end data analytics project where I analyzed e-commerce sales data using **Python, SQL, and Power BI** to derive business insights and build a professional sales dashboard.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world e-commerce analytics workflow:

1. Raw sales data ingestion
2. Data cleaning & feature engineering using Python
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Jupyter Notebook
4. SQL-based analysis for business insights
5. Interactive Sales Dashboard using Power BI

The goal is to demonstrate my skills as a **Data Analyst** using a structured, industry-style project.
